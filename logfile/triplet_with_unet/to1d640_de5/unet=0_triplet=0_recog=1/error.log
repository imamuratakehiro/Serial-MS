/home/imamura23/nas01home/codes/env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/lightning_fabric/connector.py:565: `precision=16` is supported for historical reasons but its usage is discouraged. Please set your precision to 16-mixed instead!

HINT: If your intention is to run Lightning on SLURM, prepend your python command with `srun` like so: srun python3 ./train.py ...

You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance.
